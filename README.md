# compendium

Compendium will be an [mostly] online platform consisting of a database with
profile and location data about artists, musicians, public and other cultural agents in
this context.

WRITE ABOUT A CONCRETE OBJECTIVE OF THE DEVELOPMENT: SOMETHING
LIKE ‘TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND EXCHANGE”.
The development is a response to the needs of communication, connection and for
finding artists by cultural organizers/professionals, public in general, venues and
artists themselves.

As of now, there is a lack of channels through which interested parties would find
each other in the artistic/musical scene, not only in Lithuania, but in general.
This platform will allow individuals to self-register and locate themselves in the
map. Using integration with already existing services such as GoogleMaps and/or
Facebook, information will be provided via a mobile/web interface.

The core value of the platform will be the custom-need design of the database that
will hold the information about artists. The format of the information, together with
the format of the interface to access should bring a relevant improvement to the
way we locate artist: to collaborate, organize shows/exhibitions or find events and
venues.
